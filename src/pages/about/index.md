### Scott

Scott has struggled with his weight since, like many of us, his metabolism began to slow in his 20’s and his activity level decreased. Combined with a genetic predisposition for increased waist circumference, he resigned himself to being overweight for the rest of his life. He began the journey along with Dr. Yale as they both began educating themselves and examining the scientific evidence to unlock the weight loss puzzle.

Thanks to his wife and the knowledge they have acquired, he has reached his weight loss objective and continues to maintain a healthy weight. This has fueled his passion for helping others also achieve their health and weight loss objectives. He serves as technical advisor and shares his knowledge in the free nutrition and weight loss seminars offered by Texas Weight and Wellness.
